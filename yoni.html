            I have practiced eggs since years and I have tone of them and still not bored as discovering

            <br>If it is your first introduction to yoni eggs you mind feel a bit overwhelmed and excited at the
            <br>same time. I truly believe in full power of instinct and I will  always recommended to follow
            <br>your intuition but is there tips you will maybe find useful to choose your yoni eggs.
          </p>

          <h3 class="module-title-yes-smaller font-yes">Does size matter?</h3>
          <p>
            Well, let’s be honest! It does count!
          </p>
          <p>Usually eggs come in three sizes: Large; Medium and Small
          </p>
          <p>
            I use all size of eggs depending on my need, envy and phase of my cycle as my uterus col is
            <br>not placed at the same point.
            <br>Traditionally you start with the Large and as the dexterity grows, you go down in size. The
            <br>larger it is, the easier it is to feel the egg and for the muscles to grip it.
            <br>Don’t worry, it is completely normal to feel impressed by the size at first times and also great
            <br>to start by the medium one. Once you feel comfortable with the tool inside of your yoni you
            <br>can always go back to the large egg and start to work on your sensations. After a month you
            <br>will probably feel the need to go for a medium one.
            <br>It is totally normal to don’t feel the egg at the beginning, don’t discourage yourself and take
            <br>your time to relax and meet the yoni egg.
            <br>Keep in mind that you can always get back to one or the other size and enjoy the differents
            <br>feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you had a baby or went to menopause or simply not sure which size to choose, you might
            <br>prefer a set of the three sizes and work on your way.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is important! Do not practice Yoni Egg if you are pregnant or right after childbirth.
            <br>Otherwise it is recommended to practice during postpartum to muscle your pelvic. Be sure to
            <br>talk with your doctor, doula, midwife before you start and find the support you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Small size is also a good choice if you are advanced in your practice and want to experience
            <br>new sensations.
          </p>

          <h3 class="module-title-yes-smaller font-yes">Which Crystal to choose? </h3>
          <div class="module-subtitle font-sub">
          <p>
            Choosing a crystal is my favorite part.
            <br> Natural gemstones possesses healing qualities you can taking advantage for your physical, emotional, mental and energetic well-being.
            <br>It is really fun follow your intuition when you choose a stone.
            <br>In traditional taoist practice, three semiprecious stones have been used:
            <br>Nephrite Jade Yoni Egg; Black Obsidian Yoni Egg and Rose Quartz Yoni Egg.
